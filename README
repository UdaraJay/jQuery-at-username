jQuery at-username plugin
by Bradley Abrahams for Playfire

Autocomplete usernames when typing @

Usage: apply to a textarea:
  $('textarea').atUsername(settings);

See example.html for a working example.

Settings (optional):

  containerSelector (default='.at-username-container'):
    description: string containing a selector
      If specificied, the element referenced in this selector (which should be a
      parent element of the textarea this is applied to) will be searched for
      all elements with a class of settings.usernameSelector; the $.text() value
      of these elements will be added to the searchable list of usernames.

  usernameSelector (default='.username'):
    description: string containing a selector
      If settings.containerSelector is specified, this is the selctor that will
      be used to find elements within that container which contain usernames.

  xhrUsernames (default=null):
    description: string (URL)
      If exists, this URL will be queried. It should return JSON in the
      following format:
        { usernames: [ 'username1', 'username2' ... ] }
      These usernames will be searchable by all textareas using the plugin on
      that page that also have xhrUsernames specified; the list of usernames
      will only ever be loaded in once. For example, you could load in the
      logged-in user's friends list.

  numResults (default=5):
    description: int
      The number of results to display in the autocomplete dropdown.
